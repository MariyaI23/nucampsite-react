In the <Col> or <Label> reactstrap components we can set the margins as md={10} which is the same as className=\"col-md-10\". In the <Label> component instead of using the \"for\" attribute we use htmlFor as we are in JSX. In some of the <Col> components we are using md={{size: 4,offset: 2}}. First set of {} is because we are using JS in JSX, second set of {} is because we are defining an object.This allows us to set up both the responsive size and the responsive offset for the column at the same time. This is the same as writting <div class=\"col-md-4 offset-md-2\">. We set the usual html attributes in the input tags but to make this a control form we need to set the value property that we defined before to be ={this.state.phoneNum} or whatever is applicable to the specif. input field. The exception is the input with type of checkbox. There instead of value we will use the checked attribute. Each input component also gets an onChange event handler that is set to the handleInputChange() method that was created earlier. The start <Form> tag will get an onSubmit event handler set to the method handleSubmit().Explanation about the onBlur eventhandler is by the \"touched\" property of the state.*/}\r\n
