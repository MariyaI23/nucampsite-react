export const baseUrl = "http://localhost:3001/";

//We are setting this constant to the local server we are using and ezporting this constant we can use it wherever we need the server's address
//If the server address ever changes, we only need to change it once here and it will be updated everywhere in our code where we have used the baseUrl variable
